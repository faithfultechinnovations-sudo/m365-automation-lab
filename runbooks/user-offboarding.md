User Offboarding Runbook
Purpose

Safely offboard a Microsoft 365 user using Microsoft Graph with repeatable, auditable, and idempotent steps.

This runbook disables access immediately, revokes active sessions, and optionally removes group memberships — without deleting the user object.

Designed for:

Security-first offboarding

Least-privilege Graph access

Safe re-execution (idempotent)
