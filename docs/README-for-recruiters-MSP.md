# M365 Automation Lab (MSP Recruiter Summary)

This portfolio repo demonstrates how I build repeatable, tenant-safe Microsoft 365 automation for MSP-style environments.

## MSP-relevant strengths
- **Wrong-tenant prevention** via tenant context confirmation
- Script patterns designed for standardization across multiple clients
- Clear runbooks + lifecycle grouping for consistent delivery
- Audit artifacts (transcripts/summaries) for supportability

## Reviewer path
1. `docs/reviewer-guide.md`
2. `modules/M365Automation.Common/Public/Confirm-TenantContext.ps1`
3. `scripts/onboarding/` + `scripts/offboarding/`
4. `runbooks/` for operational playbooks
