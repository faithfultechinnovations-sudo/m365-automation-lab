## Design Principles
- **Automation-first**: If it can be automated, it should be
- **Idempotent scripts**: Safe to re-run without side effects
- **Least privilege**: Secure-by-default access patterns
- **Documentation matters**: Scripts without context are liabilities
- **Realism over perfection**: Designed to mirror real environments

## Disclaimer
All scripts are designed for **lab and educational use**.  
Always review and test automation in a non-production environment before applying to real tenants.
